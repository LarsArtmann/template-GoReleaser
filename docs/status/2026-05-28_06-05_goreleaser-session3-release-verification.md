# GoReleaser-Wizard Session 3 — Release Verification Status Report

**Report Date**: 2026-05-28 06:05 CEST  
**Branch**: master (up to date with origin/master)  
**Commit**: 3d431e1  
**Session Focus**: Release readiness verification, build integrity, test coverage, architecture compliance

---

## Executive Summary

GoReleaser-Wizard has a **solid architectural foundation** and **builds cleanly**, but **release readiness is blocked by critical gaps in test coverage, architecture lint compliance, and unresolved technical debt**. The project compiles, the binary runs, and lint passes with zero issues. However, the gap between "it builds" and "it's ready to release" is significant.

**Verdict: NOT READY FOR RELEASE.** Address the top 5 blockers before tagging v1.0.

---

## a) FULLY DONE

### Build & Compilation
- `go build ./...` passes cleanly with `GOWORK=off` (parent workspace interference isolated)
- Binary builds and runs correctly (`goreleaser-wizard --help` functional)
- Go 1.26.2 toolchain configured
- All module dependencies resolve correctly
- `go mod tidy` completes without changes

### Code Quality — Linting
- `golangci-lint run ./...` reports **0 issues**
- Configuration at `.golangci.yml` is comprehensive and active
- No security lint findings
- No formatting issues

### GoReleaser Release Configuration
- `.goreleaser.yaml` is production-grade with comprehensive distribution targets:
  - Multi-platform builds (linux, darwin, windows × amd64, arm64)
  - Docker images for amd64 + arm64 with manifest merging
  - GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
  - Homebrew tap formula generation
  - Scoop Windows package support
  - NFPM (.deb, .rpm, .apk)
  - Nix package with nixfmt formatter
  - Cosign keyless signing
  - Syft SBOM generation
  - SHA-256 checksums
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` is complete with proper permissions and actions

### Domain Architecture
- Clean Architecture separation maintained (domain / application / infrastructure)
- 30+ type-safe enums with validation methods
- Comprehensive error type system with structured codes and context
- Template system extracted to dedicated files
- Job execution framework with rollback support
- Event-driven architecture with typed events

### Documentation
- `AGENTS.md` with project conventions and commands
- `FEATURES.md` with detailed status tracking
- `CHANGELOG.md` present (though under-maintained)
- `CONSUMER_PERSPECTIVE.md` with gap analysis
- Modular documentation structure in `docs/`

---

## b) PARTIALLY DONE

### Test Suite
- **Status**: Tests PASS but coverage is unacceptably low for release.
- Packages with tests:
  - `cmd/goreleaser-wizard`: 52.0% coverage
  - `internal/domain`: 0.7% coverage (effectively untested)
  - `internal/types`: 5.2% coverage
  - `internal/validation`: 57.7% coverage
- **12 test files** across 73 Go files — far below a healthy ratio
- Many packages have **zero test files**: `generators`, `templates`, `internal/config`, `internal/git`, `internal/utils`
- `test-wizard/` subdirectory exists but appears to be a sandbox, not part of the test suite

### Architecture Lint Compliance
- `go-arch-lint check` **FAILS** with two missing component directories:
  - `internal/errors/**` — referenced in `.go-arch-lint.yml` but directory was removed during error refactoring (commit dde1081)
  - `pkg/errors/**` — referenced but directory never existed or was removed
- These are stale references in the archfile, not architecture violations per se, but they block automated compliance checks

### Documentation Accuracy
- `AGENTS.md` references `just build`, `just test`, `just ci` — but no `justfile` exists in the repository (was migrated/removed)
- `AGENTS.md` directory structure section lists files that don't exist (e.g., `internal/errors/domain_errors.go`)
- `FEATURES.md` claims many features are FULLY_FUNCTIONAL but some capabilities are thin wrappers or templates without full runtime logic

### Nix Integration
- `nix/package.nix` exists
- `flake.nix` exists (added in recent commits)
- Not verified to build successfully with `nix build`
- `.goreleaser.yaml` references Nix package generation but `skip_upload: auto` means it may not actually publish

---

## c) NOT STARTED

### Comprehensive Integration Testing
- No end-to-end tests for the full wizard flow
- No tests verifying generated `.goreleaser.yaml` files are valid GoReleaser configs
- No tests for GitHub Actions workflow generation output
- No Docker build tests for generated Dockerfiles

### Performance Benchmarking
- No benchmark tests exist
- No performance regression framework
- Performance estimation code exists but is not validated against real measurements

### Release Automation Verification
- `goreleaser check` has not been run to validate the `.goreleaser.yaml`
- No test releases (snapshots) have been executed
- Docker image build has not been tested locally
- Homebrew formula generation has not been inspected

### Security Audit
- No `gosec` scan results on file
- No dependency vulnerability scan (govulncheck)
- Cosign signing configuration is present but never tested end-to-end

---

## d) TOTALLY FUCKED UP!

### Critical: `go-arch-lint` Blocked by Stale Config
```
not found directories for 'internal/errors/**'
not found directories for 'pkg/errors/**'
```
**Impact**: Automated architecture compliance checks fail. This is a hard blocker for CI pipelines that enforce arch-lint.  
**Root Cause**: Error types were migrated from `internal/errors` to `internal/domain` (commit dde1081) but `.go-arch-lint.yml` was never updated.  
**Fix Effort**: 5 minutes — update or remove the stale component definitions.

### Critical: Test Coverage Catastrophically Low
| Package | Coverage | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| `internal/domain` | 0.7% | Catastrophic |
| `internal/config` | 0.0% | None |
| `generators` | 0.0% | None |
| `internal/git` | 0.0% | None |
| `internal/utils` | 0.0% | None |
| `cmd/goreleaser-wizard` | 52.0% | Marginal |

The domain layer — the heart of the application's business logic — is effectively untested. A refactor here is high-risk.

### Critical: `jobs.go` Still Contains `map[string]any` Usage
Despite a project-wide effort to eliminate `map[string]any`, `cmd/goreleaser-wizard/jobs.go` still contains:
```go
// CRITICAL TODO: Replace map[string]any with strongly typed structs
// TODO: Eliminate all map[string]any usage - this is unacceptable
```
This is a direct contradiction to the claim of "100% type safety achieved" in the June 2025 status report.

### Critical: Large Files Not Split
Multiple files exceed 300 lines with explicit TODOs calling for splitting:
- `cmd/goreleaser-wizard/workflow.go`: 415 lines
- `cmd/goreleaser-wizard/validate_test.go`: 489 lines
- `cmd/goreleaser-wizard/architecture_test.go`: 412 lines
- `cmd/goreleaser-wizard/jobs.go`: ~300+ lines

These were flagged in the previous status report and remain unaddressed.

---

## e) WHAT WE SHOULD IMPROVE!

### 1. Fix `.go-arch-lint.yml` Stale References (Immediate)
Update the architecture lint config to reflect the actual directory structure after the error migration.

### 2. Add Meaningful Domain Layer Tests (High Priority)
The domain layer has rich enums and validation logic that is completely untested. Even basic table-driven tests for enum validation would raise coverage dramatically.

### 3. Verify Release Pipeline End-to-End (High Priority)
Run `goreleaser check`, `goreleaser release --snapshot --clean`, and inspect outputs. The config looks good on paper but may have runtime issues.

### 4. Update `AGENTS.md` and `FEATURES.md` (Medium Priority)
These docs have drifted from the actual codebase. Remove references to `justfile` commands if no justfile exists. Correct directory listings. Update feature statuses to be honest about what's a template vs. working runtime logic.

### 5. Address `map[string]any` in `jobs.go` (Medium Priority)
Either finish the type-safe refactor or remove the contradictory claims from documentation. Technical debt is fine; lying about it is not.

### 6. Split Large Files (Medium Priority)
The files flagged in June 2025 are still monolithic. Pick one per session and extract focused sub-packages.

### 7. Add Generator Tests (Medium Priority)
The template generators produce real artifacts. They should have golden-file tests or at minimum output validation.

### 8. Nix Build Verification (Low Priority)
Verify `nix build` and `nix flake check` work. The Nix support is a differentiator but only if it actually functions.

## g) Top #1 Question I Cannot Figure Out Myself

**Why does `AGENTS.md` still reference a `justfile` and `just` commands when no `justfile` exists in the repository, and what is the canonical build/test command the project actually expects developers to use?**

- The `justfile` was apparently removed or migrated (history shows `justfile` commits and a "remove enterprise-grade architecture linting justfile" commit), but `AGENTS.md` — the primary onboarding document — still lists `just build`, `just test`, `just ci` as essential commands.
- There is no `Makefile` either.
- The only remaining automation appears to be `flake.nix` and the GitHub Actions workflow.
- This creates a **new-developer onboarding trap**: they read `AGENTS.md`, try `just build`, and hit a wall.
- **What is the intended developer workflow?** Should we:
  - Re-add a `justfile`?
  - Update `AGENTS.md` to use `go` commands directly?
  - Add a `flake.nix` devShell with the proper commands?

This is not a technical question — it's a **process/orientation question** that requires a product-level decision on developer experience.
