# GoReleaser Wizard Status Report

**Date:** 2025-11-17  
**Time:** 13:23  
**Author:** Crush AI Assistant  
**Status:** CRITICAL - BUILD FAILURE  
**Overall Health:** 🔴 CRITICAL (2/10)

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current Situation

**The application is in a CRITICAL FAILURE state** with complete build system collapse. Despite implementing foundational domain architecture and type safety improvements, the project is UNBUILDABLE and UNTESTABLE.

### Immediate Blockers

1. **Complete Build Failure**: `just build` fails with 8+ compilation errors
2. **Duplicate Declarations**: Multiple functions/variables defined across files
3. **Type System Chaos**: Pointer mismatches and undefined references
4. **Interface Compliance Issues**: LoggerAdapter missing critical methods

### Architectural Assessment

- ✅ **Domain Layer**: Compiles successfully, strong type foundations in place
- ⚠️ **Application Layer**: Partially implemented, missing repository patterns
- ❌ **Presentation Layer**: Complete failure due to compilation errors
- 🚨 **Infrastructure Layer**: Ghost systems and legacy code causing split-brain

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### Build System Blockers (Must Fix Before Anything Else)

1. **Duplicate validateCmd declaration** - Blocks compilation completely
2. **appLogger redeclaration conflict** - Prevents logger initialization
3. **Results object pointer mismatches** - Breaks validation system
4. **Missing Logger interface methods** - Prevents proper error handling
5. **Circular import resolution** - Creates compilation deadlocks

### Architectural Integrity Issues (Must Fix for Long-term Viability)

1. **Complete ProjectConfig migration** - Remove all legacy type references
2. **Implement all repository patterns** - Enable proper testing and separation
3. **Eliminate ghost systems** - Remove duplicate/conflicting code paths
4. **Standardize error handling** - Use domain errors exclusively
5. **Consolidate validation logic** - Single source of truth for validation

## 🚨 BLOCKING ISSUES REQUIRING DECISION

### Architectural Direction Confusion

**The project shows conflicting objectives:**

- Production-ready CLI tool vs. Architecture demonstration vs. Rapid prototype vs. Legacy migration
- Domain-first design vs. Fast iteration vs. Backward compatibility vs. New features
- Comprehensive testing vs. Quick deployment vs. Perfect patterns vs. Working system

**Decision Required:** Should I focus on (A) making current system build and work, or (B) implementing perfect domain-driven architecture first?

### Technical Debt Management

**Current technical debt requires prioritization:**

- Build system failure (blocks all development)
- No testing coverage (blocks production deployment)
- Duplicate code (blocks maintainability)
- Missing documentation (blocks team collaboration)

**Decision Required:** Should I address issues in build order (fix build → test → document) or importance order (architecture → testing → build)?

## 🏁 CONCLUSION

### Current State: **CRITICAL FAILURE**

The GoReleaser Wizard is in an unbuildable, untested, undocumented state despite having solid architectural foundations. The project requires immediate emergency intervention to restore basic functionality before any feature development can proceed.

### Immediate Priority: **BUILD SYSTEM RECOVERY**

Focus exclusively on fixing compilation errors and establishing working build system. All other objectives (testing, documentation, performance) must wait until basic compilation succeeds.

### Success Path: **INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT**

Follow established Pareto priorities: fix critical path items first (1%→51% impact), then professional polish (4%→64% impact), then complete package (20%→80% impact).

---

**NEXT ACTION REQUIRED:** Begin Phase 1 emergency build fixes starting with duplicate declaration removal.
