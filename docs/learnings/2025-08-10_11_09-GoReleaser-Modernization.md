# Learnings from GoReleaser Template Modernization Session

Date: 2025-08-10T11:09:33+02:00

## Key Learnings

### 1. Ghost Systems Detection
**Learning**: Ghost systems are everywhere in template projects
- **Pattern**: Code that compiles but does nothing useful
- **Example**: myproject binary that only prints version
- **Solution**: Either remove completely or implement real functionality
- **Principle**: Every piece of code should provide value or be deleted

### 2. Bash to Go Migration Strategy
**Learning**: Complex bash scripts indicate missing Go abstractions
- **Pattern**: 2000+ lines of bash validation logic
- **Root Cause**: Avoiding Go development complexity
- **Solution**: Create proper Go packages with types and tests
- **Benefit**: Type safety, testability, maintainability

### 3. Library Selection Criteria
**Learning**: Not all recommended libraries fit every use case
- **Anti-pattern**: Blindly adding every suggested library
- **Example**: sqlc for a project with no database
- **Solution**: Evaluate each library against actual requirements
- **Principle**: "Use existing libraries" ≠ "Use all libraries"

### 4. Architecture Pattern Applicability
**Learning**: Complex patterns need business justification
- **Anti-pattern**: Event-sourcing for configuration management
- **Reality Check**: CQRS for a CLI tool is over-engineering
- **Solution**: Start simple, evolve based on actual needs
- **Principle**: Architecture should match problem complexity

### 5. Modern Go Web Stack
**Learning**: gin + templ + htmx is a powerful combination
- **Discovery**: Type-safe templates with templ eliminate template bugs
- **Insight**: HTMX provides SPA-like experience without JavaScript complexity
- **Pattern**: Server-side rendering is making a comeback
- **Benefit**: Simpler mental model, better SEO, faster initial load

### 6. Dependency Injection in Go
**Learning**: samber/do provides clean DI without magic
- **Pattern**: Explicit service registration and resolution
- **Benefit**: Testable, maintainable service architecture
- **Gotcha**: Don't over-use DI for simple dependencies
- **Balance**: Use DI for cross-cutting concerns, not everything

### 7. CLI Framework Selection
**Learning**: cobra + fang provides professional CLI experience
- **Insight**: Fang adds batteries without complexity
- **Pattern**: Subcommands for logical grouping
- **Benefit**: Automatic help generation and flag parsing
- **Enhancement**: Viper integration for configuration management

### 8. Test Framework Migration
**Learning**: Gradual migration from testify to ginkgo is complex
- **Challenge**: Different testing paradigms (assertion vs BDD)
- **Reality**: Existing tests provide value even if not ideal
- **Strategy**: Migrate incrementally, prioritize new tests
- **Compromise**: Mixed test frameworks during transition

### 9. Validation Architecture
**Learning**: Validation deserves first-class treatment
- **Pattern**: Separate validation package with clear types
- **Structure**: Input → Validation → Result with issues
- **Enhancement**: User-friendly errors with remediation steps
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for all validators

### 10. Template vs Implementation Dilemma
**Learning**: Templates need working examples to be useful
- **Problem**: Pure templates can't be tested
- **Solution**: Implement minimal working functionality
- **Balance**: Enough code to demonstrate, not production-complete
- **Documentation**: Clear markers for template vs example code

## Anti-Patterns Discovered

1. **Import-driven development**: Adding imports that don't exist
2. **Planning paralysis**: 250-task plans without execution
3. **Tool worship**: Using tools because they're popular, not needed
4. **Complexity creep**: Adding patterns before problems exist
5. **Documentation debt**: Writing code without updating docs

## Best Practices Confirmed

1. **Incremental migration**: Port one script at a time
2. **Type-first design**: Define types before implementation
3. **Test-driven validation**: Write tests for validators first
4. **User-centric errors**: Technical details + user guidance
5. **Commit frequently**: Small, atomic, well-described commits

## Tooling Insights

### Effective Tools
- **jscpd**: Excellent for finding code duplication
- **gh CLI**: Powerful for issue management
- **just**: Superior to make for modern projects
- **templ**: Game-changer for Go templates

### Overhead Tools
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Often ignored in practice
- **Complex linters**: Diminishing returns beyond basics
- **Architecture linters**: Premature for small projects

## Process Improvements

1. **Start with working code**: Fix issues in functioning systems
2. **Parallel task execution**: Use concurrent agents for independent work
3. **Continuous validation**: Test after every change
4. **Documentation as code**: Generate docs from code when possible
5. **Feedback loops**: Quick iteration over perfect planning

## Future Recommendations

1. **Define clear boundaries**: Template vs tool vs service
2. **User journey first**: Design from user experience backward
3. **Progressive enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
4. **Measure everything**: Add metrics before optimization
5. **Automate repetitively**: If done twice, script it

## Session Metrics

- **Tasks Completed**: 8 major implementations
- **Lines of Code**: ~3000 added (Go), 650 migrated (bash to Go)
- **Dependencies Added**: 12 (purposeful, not arbitrary)
- **Tests Written**: 200+ unit tests
- **Documentation Created**: 5 comprehensive documents
- **Ghost Systems Eliminated**: 4 major, multiple minor
- **Technical Debt Reduced**: ~30% of bash scripts migrated

## Conclusion

The session demonstrated that modernizing legacy code requires:
1. **Brutal honesty** about what exists vs what works
2. **Incremental progress** over perfect planning
3. **Pragmatic choices** over dogmatic patterns
4. **User value** over technical elegance
5. **Working code** over comprehensive documentation

The key insight: **Transform templates into tools by adding just enough implementation to be useful, but not so much that it becomes inflexible.**
